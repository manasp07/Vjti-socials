basically u can sort the string in string vector by using sort function in the sorting.

for binary search tree to detect whether it has a dead end there is a simple logic that the either the right end of the tree will be maximum or
the left end of the tree will be minimum there will be no node in the range of node-1 and node + 1.
Hence we will find the dead end of the binary search tree
